# E-commerce_order_processing_system
gram implements a Mini Store Management System using linked lists, a BST, a queue, and a stack. Admins can add and display customers and products. Customers can place orders, view products, undo their last order, and check order history. Orders are stored in a queue, and the stack enables undo functionality using LIFO.
